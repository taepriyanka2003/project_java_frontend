<p>This field focuses on concepts of electrical engineering, electronic devices and relevant software. Electronics and Communication Engineering is also known by the short name of EC Engineering.</p>
<p>Various engineering branches such as- electrical, computer science and telecommunication overlaps EC Engineering. It consists of elements of the above mentioned engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>We use wide variety of electronic goods in our day to day lives. TV, mobile phones, Computers etc are some of the well known examples. Electronics and Communication engineering is involved in the design, manufacturing and maintenance of such electronic equipment.</p>
<p>EC Engineering not only deals with small household electronic goods. It also deals with design, manufacturing and maintenance of electrical and electronic systems used in large and medium sized industries too!</p>
<p>The prime focus of EC Engineering can be said to be on design, analysis and manufacturing of electronic and communication circuits. Some of the important subjects covered in this discipline include- Control systems, Logic design, VLSI, PCB Design, Circuit Networks, Integrated circuits, Electrical systems, Communication engineering, Signal processing, Sensors etc.</p>
<div align="center"><h2>DIPLOMA IN ECE ENGINEERING: </h2></div>
<h3>COURSE DETAILS</h3>
<p>Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering is a 3 years long program. The academic program is divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months.</p>
<p>Few institutes are also offering Integrated program- Diploma + B.Tech. Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
<p>Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering course trains students in areas such as-Electronic circuits, Electrical systems, Communication engineering, Signal systems, Signal processing, VLSI, Software etc</p>
<h2>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</h4>
<p>Students who have passed 10th standard are eligible to pursue this course. This course can also be pursued after 10+2 Science stream (Mathematics group)!</p>
<h2>ADMISSION PROCESS AND COLLEGES</h2>
<p>Many polytechnic, technical education and engineering institutes across India are offering this program. Most institutes usually have the ‘direct admission’ process. Interested students have to approach the institute and fill up the admission form. Seats will be allotted to deserving students on the basis of marks scored by them in 10th board examination (usually in Mathematics and Science subjects).</p>
<h2>HIGHER STUDIES AND PG COURSES</h2>
<p>After completing Diploma in Electronics and Communication Engineering program, one may go for Bachelor’s Degree (B.E./B.Tech.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering! In most Degree Engineering colleges, certain percentages of seats are reserved for Diploma certificate holders. This entry is known as the lateral entry. Diploma holders with good grade may make use of lateral entry and join B.E./B.Tech. Electronics and Communication Engineering program’s 2nd academic year (directly). This way, Diploma holders may make the ‘DtoD’ switch and earn a Bachelor of Engineering/Technology Degree!</p>
<p>After that, one may go for Master’s education or PG Diploma programs. M.E./M.Tech. program, M.Sc. program and PG Diploma courses will enable one to specialize in disciplines within the Electronics and Communication Engineering sector. Some such well known specializations include-</p>
