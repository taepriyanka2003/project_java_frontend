An integral part of many MBA programs is a summer internship between the first and second years, offering practical experience and industry exposure. Additionally, students often undertake a capstone project or thesis to apply their learning to real-world business challenges. Admission to an MBA program usually requires a bachelor's degree, relevant work experience, and satisfactory scores on entrance exams like the GMAT or GRE.</p>
